# Regression-Investigation
An investigation into the performance of different regression models.

For the purposes of this investigation, I used a dataset of students performance, where given factors such as their weekly study time, involvement in sports/extracurriculars/music, parental support, etc., the weighted GPA of the student is predicted.

I found that the best performing model was the polynomial regression model with MinMax scaling on a degree of 2.
